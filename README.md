# Lakeland Industries Analysis (NASDAQ: LAKE)
---
## Overview
Lakeland Industries provides safety and protective equipment and clothing, mainly for workplaces that deal with chemicals or are in danger of contracting any illnesses. The demand for Lakeland's products has obviously soared during the COVID-19 pandemic as hospitals and other healthcare facilities require workers to be equipped with protective gear to prevent the spread of the disease. Below, I will highlight some sections of Lakeland's financial statements, many of which saw great success in 2020 due to the increased demand for the company's products.

## Profitability, etc.

#### Gross Profit Margin
- Lakeland has achieved a Gross Profit Margin over 25% for the past 10 years and 10-year-high of 49.8% was reported in January 2021. The large return in 2020 can be attributed to a spike in revenue which grew at a faster rate than their COGS. 

#### Operating Expenses
- Lakeland's Operating Expenses remained fairly stagnant between 2011 and 2018, fluctuating between $25M and $28M, and have steadily increased to $35M over the last 3 fiscal years. Nearly the entirety of the company's Operating Expenses come from their SG&A expenses. While they have experienced increases over the last 3 years, Lakeland's Operating Expenses only grew 25% over those 3 years in comparison to a 65.6% increase in their revenues. 

#### Interest Expenses
- Lakeland's recent Interest Expenses are a bright spot when looking at their income statement as they have not had any interest expenses at all over the last 4 years. This is reflective of the absence of short-term and long-term debt on their balance sheets. 

#### Net Income
- Lakeland's Net Income hovered between $0M and $4M between from 2015-2019, but it soared to $35M in 2020. Given Lakeland's business, this major increase can obviously be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic when there was a rise in demand for protective equipment for all the healthcare workers battling the virus. 

#### Diluted EPS
- Lakeland had a few years of negative EPS in the early 2010s and were not able to surpass $0.53 between 2015 and 2019. However, their successful 2020 resulted in a diluted EPS value of $4.31.

#### Cash Flow
- Lakeland's Net Change in Cash also benefited greatly as expected from the company's successful 2020. After a loss of $3M in 2018 and a net change of only $2M in 2019, Lakeland achieved a net change of $38M in 2020. 

#### Return on Equity
- Lakeland's ROE was also very positive in 2020 reporting at 33.8% compared to their lackluster ROEs that did not surpass 4% for three years prior.

#### Debt
- With their successful 2020, Lakeland's Total Liabilities only increased to $17M from 2019's $14M, and $13M of that comes from Current Liabilities. For the second year in a row, Lakeland has reported no long-term debt.  

#### Current Ratio

## Additional Factors

## Summary
As displayed many times, Lakeland's revenues and earnings saw great increases in 2020 due to increased demand during the pandemic. This is the main reason for the company's improved financials and increased stock price. Now that we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is worth questioning whether or not the demand for Lakeland's protective equipment will decrease or remain as is. Even with vaccinations and immunity being built, most healthcare workers will likely still likely be required to take caution and wear the protective gear to prevent any possibility of spreading the disease. However, the quantities in which these facilities purchase the products may still decrease. If the demand falls, Lakeland may not achieve the same revenues they did in 2020.

With the world returning to normal, it might be appropriate to look back at Lakeland's financials prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to get a sense of what to expect in a post-COVID world. Although Lakeland had been maintaing decent revenues and Gross Profit Margins, their EPS and Net Income were not so successful before 2020. But with healthcare facilities maintaining caution for the foreseeable future, there is reason to speculate that the decrease in Lakeland's revenues wouldn't fall off too drastically from 2020's numbers. 

On the other hand, Lakeland was still displaying signs of good liquidity even before the pandemic hit. They had little to no debt for the last few years of the decade and maintained a healthy Current Ratio. Lakeland's stock price has fallen quite a bit from February's high of nearly $48 to $26 at the time of this analysis. It is unlikely that the price will reach the $40 range again anytime soon, but with volatility from the pandemic slowing down and the company's financial health, there is potential for the price to balance out soon and achieve steady growth.
