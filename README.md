#### Gross Profit Margin
- Lakeland has achieved a Gross Profit Margin over 25% for the past 10 years and 10-year-high of 49.8% was reported in January 2021. The large return in 2020 can be attributed to a spike in revenue which grew at a faster rate than their COGS. 

#### Operating Expenses
- Lakeland's Operating Expenses remained fairly stagnant between 2011 and 2018, fluctuating between $25M and $28M, and have steadily increased to $35M over the last 3 fiscal years. Nearly the entirety of the company's Operating Expenses come from their SG&A expenses. While they have experienced increases over the last 3 years, Lakeland's Operating Expenses only grew 25% over those 3 years in comparison to a 65.6% increase in their revenues. 

#### Interest Expenses
- Lakeland's recent Interest Expenses are a bright spot when looking at their income statement as they have not had any interest expenses at all over the last 4 years. This is reflective of the absence of short-term and long-term debt on their balance sheets.
